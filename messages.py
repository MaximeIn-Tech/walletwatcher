An important thing for me is to keep users anonymous so the only thing that is kept is your Chat_ID with the bot.
In that, he will know who to send messages to and not mix up the data from everyone.

Other than that, the bot doesn't log:
    - Your IP
    - Your username
    - Any other information that would identify you as a user.
